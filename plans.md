## Database Relationships

Plan: Creating objects for different subjects
- Objects that are created are possessed by the users who created them
- Can modify properties or delete, but any user can read the object and see the calculations they have made

Subjects: 
- Physics: Objects with mass, velocities, forces, etc.
- Chemistry: Objects with mass, volume, attributes, etc.
- Stats: Objects with datasets, attributes such as means and medians, test statistics, etc.
- Biology: Objects with alleles, attributes such as genotypes, etc.
