## Team DADY Project

[Runtime](https://dylanluo05.github.io/DADY-Academy/)

What is DADY Academy? It's a tools website for different STEM classes, specifically Physics, Biology, Chemistry, and Statistics. They are specifically created to be useful based on what we have experienced and may have needed while we were taking these classes. Why DADY? It's our names: Dylan, Aryan, Daniel, and Yash (and then Rohan joined later). Enjoy!

Our goal is to create a website that we would want to use - as it is applicable to classes we are taking or have taken, and something that we would use if we needed help in the class. We also want to make it as easy to use and navigate through as possible.
